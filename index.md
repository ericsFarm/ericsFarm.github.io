## About

Welcome to my personal project page! Here you’ll find content related to the various projects and activities I work on in my free time. A common theme here is that these are useful skills that I often have no prior experience with, but am learning as I go along. If you are an expert in these fields, or expecting me to be one, this page will probably not be of much value to you. 

The fact is, I didn’t learn many practical skills in my youth. I did reasonably well in school but didn’t really put in too much effort. Instead, I mostly daydreamed throughout class until whatever sports practice of the season came around. Five years ago, I graduated with an engineering degree… only to go out into the world and find out that I didn’t know how to *do* anything. Historically, it’s been a very distressing experience for me to screw up some basic physical task i.e. repair or otherwise, that you “should” know (but were never taught), especially in front of others. This then leads to years of shying away from this type of work, thus making the problem worse. This seems to be a common experience amongst people in their mid-late 20s, and even beyond. For some folks, that’s alright. We live in a society where in many cases, you are not required to do anything but perform non-transferrable skills for 8 hours and return home to watch Netflix and consume the latest third-order reboot, after ordering from UberEats or picking up fast food on the way home. If you are satisfied with this station in life, then power to you. I’m certainly in no position to judge. But if you’re reading this, it’s probably because in some way, you’re not. 

Fortunately, in that same society we live in, we have access to the entirety of human knowledge in a matter of seconds and for the price of an internet connection. If we want to learn to become more self-sufficient, sustainable, and skilled individuals, we have that power, and it’s up to us to make it happen. 

Honestly, this is mostly for me as a way to record and document these activities. But if this is content that you enjoy, I hope that this is helpful for you in your own life, or maybe even inspires you to try things you have never done before. There is a very real sense of accomplishment from learning and doing things yourself.
