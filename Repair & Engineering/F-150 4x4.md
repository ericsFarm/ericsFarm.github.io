# F-150 Repairs, mods, and upgrades


I bought my 1994 F-150 in the late summer of 2021. It was certainly not in "mint" condition, but I was
looking for a low-cost 4WD vehicle to become a project that I could both work on, and drive on the beach. After 
seeking advice from a friend, I struck a deal with the former owners to take it off their hands for 2500 dollars. It ran, 
and the 4 wheel drive worked, although the engine light was on, it had surface rust, the headliner was falling apart, the 
radio was not usuable, in addition to many other workable-but-needs-addressing items under the hood. Nonetheless, I drove away 
with it and with a lighter wallet. While I do have some mild superstitions, I am not a woo-woo energy destiny person. However, 
I do know the feeling I get when something exactly fits my life and is good for me in my current time and place, and I definitely
got it with this vehicle. I cannot describe its color to you in words, because I honestly can't tell whether it is dark blue 
or dark green, depending on the time of day. The factory paint code says it is called "Dark Tourmaline", which ironically I 
found is a type of crystal. Go figure. Its fenders are accented by faded white pinstripes, the style and quality of which has 
not been replicated since the OBS Ford days. One of the famous two-tone schemes or a sweep would be nice, but until I take a serious
look at the paint job, the current style fits me just fine for now.

So let's get down to the work that's been done so far. And keep in mind, I am no automotive expert, everything I have done 
below, I just looked up on the internet or in the Haynes manual I purchased. 

The first thing I wanted to do was identify the potential immediate engine issues. Being that the modern OBDII automtive 
diagnostic system did not come about until 1996, this wasn't as easy as sticking in a code reader. However, this vehicle 
was recent enough to feature its predecessor, OBDI. In order to read a code, you need to jumper a special port under the 
hood, and then the check engine dash light will blink in different patterns, from which you must decipher the code. The old 
ways are not always convenient, who would have thought? Anyways, the code that came up was for a bad vehicle speed sensor, 
which deals with changing gears in the automatic transmission. I changed that which wasn't too difficult. Then I went ahead
and replaced all the spark plugs and cables as well as the distributor cap. The spark plugs turned out to be original from 
the factory, and took quite a bit of time and WD-40 to come loose. After all that, the engine light was gone. 

When I mention brands on this page, I do it with the intention of making it simple to follow what I did rather than as an
endorsement of that brand. However I will make a note here that will be out of character for this page, as it is the closest 
I am going to get to a "plug", but that is that almost all of the replacement parts I have bought for this vehicle are from 
RockAuto. I know there are higher end places to go with top of the line and competition parts, and probably cheaper places to 
go as well, but RockAuto is a great place for beginners. You can easily search your year, make, and model, and they have already 
done the work to find which parts are compatible. This can save you a lot of time and money if you are just starting out and 
don't want to sift through forums for hours, or make costly mistakes ordering incompatible parts. There are many many places to buy auto parts and I recommend you find which ones suit you best. But in a pinch, this is where I have gone.

As far as the interior goes, the headliner was the first issue I tackled. Sagging headliners are a common occurrence in older
vehicles that have been sitting outdoors. I removed the plastic interior trim and clips holding it in place, and took it down. 
I used a wire brush to scrape what was left of the foam adhesive from the cardboard backing. For the replacement, I purchased
two items: 3M Automotive headliner trim from Walmart, and some plaid Carolina blue and white cloth from Joann fabrics. I basically followed similar youtube videos of what other folks had done, used the spray adhesive, stuck the new liner on the backing one
half side at a time, then let it dry and later cut it down to size. Then I just reinstalled it how I found it. I wish I could find 
that plaid again because I'd love to use it for other projects, but looks like it was a limited run.

As far as the radio, I went to the local pick-n-pull, and found an exact replica after a very long hike to the back, inside
a 1994 Ford Ranger. The display goes in and out, but the radio functions as a whole and I like the original look, so I haven't 
replaced it with a modern upgrade. Plus it has a tape deck, that I got to work after clearing some wound up tape of some other poor
driver's prized cassette. I often use a bluetooth FM transmitter to play my music, however one of these days I am going to get around
to making some literal mixtapes and keep them in the glovebox. 

The next item of business and the next significant mechanical job, was replacing the rear differential gasket. I purchased the
replacement gasket and gear oil from Rock Auto, in addition to some differential additive. Because my truck has a limited slip 
differential, it is recommended that an extra additive goes in with the main fluid. I set out to drain the rear diff, scrape off what 
was left of the old seal, clean everything out as best I could, and apply the new seal and then reassemble the housing. 
If you have done this before then you know, but if not, let me just tell you that gear oil smells absolutely horrible. Rotten 
industrial gunk is the best way I can describe it, but that doesn't do it justice. Anyway, once that was finished and everything seemed in order, I was on to the next issue.

One day while I was out on the beach, the truck overheated and started spewing coolant out of the reservoir. It appeared I had none
left. I limped it back to the lot where I called a friend for help and got some more coolant into it. Being that this was a gunked up 
old system, I ran a complete coolant flush. I got the coolant flush fluid from a local parts store, as well as several gallons of 
distilled water from the grocery store. I ran these through the system in sequence, hoping to flush any gunk out of it.
I drained it after each time, for a total of three flushes, the first with the cleaner and the second two with distilled water. The
engine temp stayed happy for a good amount of time... more on that later on. In the meantime, I'd like to talk about the amount of 
waste that is generated by both this process and replacing the differntial fluid. After all was said and done, I had something like 7 
gallons of toxic industrial waste on my hands from these two jobs. I ended up finding that the only place I could safely and legally 
take it was a special station at the landfill early on Saturday mornings. So that's what I did. If you perform these jobs, I would 
recommend to find your local safe disposal site prior to getting started. Please dispose of these waste fluids properly. They are 
harmful to humans and animals, and the ethylene glycol found in engine coolant has a sweet scent that is liable to be ingested by 
wildlife, pets, or small children... so please, just do the right thing.

After completing these general repair items, of which many more need to be done, I wanted to start on designing something new. The 
great thing about this vehicle and offroad travel in general is that it has given me practical problems to solve. I settled on a 
combination package of a new control console as well as an onboard air compression and exhaust system for my tires. If you have spent 
any time offroading or driving on a beach, you will know that traction is key, and an important way to increase traction is to release 
air out of your tires, or "air down" as you might hear your local 4x4 bro (or chick - don't want to leave out the Jeep girls) say.
For the weekend warrior, you can get by as I did for a long time with mini Slime compressor. But if you make this a regular activity, 
spending 25 minutes in a blazing hot parking lot with a pipsqueak compressor becomes rather unappealing, and the smaller compressors 
have shorter duty cycles where they will need a break so as not to overheat. So, I wanted to upgrade in this area. There are multiple 
kits on the market including hose splitter kits, up to one with full pressure monitoring and a smartphone app with pressure presets 
where your air up or down automatically stops upon completion. I did not find anything on the market that fit my needs, which were 
rather unique. I needed a.) a bigger center console with cupholders (due to the focus on the bench seats of the 90s, many F-150s only 
came with a small plastic console that sat on the floor) b.) Pressure Gauge c.) exhaust valve d.) Switches or another method of control e.) Tachometer (again some F-150s did not come with a fully loaded dash) f.) SWR meter for my CB radio

Wanting to roll all of this in one, I designed my new center console that housed the tach, pressure gauge, air pressure control 
switches, SWR meter, and cupholders. This was a very custom job that I had a very specific vision for, which is in part why it took so 
long to complete. The frame is built out of spare zebrawood I had from a previous project making plaques, and I 3D printed the SWR 
mount and cupholders with PLA material. There are still some loose ends I am tying up, but it is functionally complete. I will be 
adding the schematics of how this is wired soon, as well as photos, in case you would like to do something similar. And to be honest, I 
am pretty satisfied with how it has turned out. I especially enjoy the effect at night when the backlighting I wired up to the gauge 
faces comes alive.


I almost forgot, on the body side I did end up replacing the front and rear bumpers with rust-free matching year chrome ones from the
pick n pull. It's hard to overstate how big of an aesthetic difference they have made, the vehicle looks a lot more respectable.
Ayways, this is as far as I have gotten for now, as colder weather approaches and I will be winding down work on the truck until I 
return in the springtime. However, I will add some thoughts before concluding this section for now. I do own two vehicles. Both 
are used, and have a combined age of 45. My idea on this is that I have two vehicles paid off, definitely requiring maintenance, but if 
one has to be repaired then I can still drive the other. Another point of view I have with the vehicle age is that I do not like to be 
limited by software dependence. I am not just talking about electronically controlled drivetrain parts, but rather that non-essential 
and increasingly essential functions are now becoming controlled by closed-source, proprietary software. My right-to-repair rant is one 
for another day, but it is just another layer of complexity that I do not want or need, is used to justify cost increases, and is 
another thing that can go wrong. While they do have their own, older vehicles don't have that issue. Another benefit of this 
two-vehicle method is that it allows for errors when you are working on one. I was previously afraid to do much work myself when I 
owned only one vehicle, because if I made a mistake and goofed something up, then that was my only way to get around. Now I can do more
of my own work without the fear of becoming immobile. That being said, I limit my work to this truck, 
and leave my daily driver to the professionals. 

To go along with the diagrams and photos, I may come back and make a condensed section where I add the bill of materials, condensed 
procedures, etc. so you can skip the pinterest-recipe storyline and get to the point.
